   This was a shareware program.  In May 1997 I decided to place it in
   the public domain as work commitments mean I can no longer find
   the time to sell or support it.  So, as from now it's public domain.
   :)

   One of the consequences of that decision is that you can now get
   hold of the online hints for free.  You should find that typing
   HINT at the command-prompt inside Humbug gives you either a subtle
   or sledge-hammer clue.  If not, you can download the hint-enabled
   version from my website:  http://members.aol.com/gcluley

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   An adventure such as HUMBUG will allow you to enter a wide variety of
   commands such as GO NORTH, ASK GRANDAD ABOUT THE WUMPUS, and GET
   EVERYTHING IN THE DUSTBIN APART FROM THE DWEEZIL.

   All of these commands are entered at the  >  prompt.

   A wide vocabulary is understood by HUMBUG. Obviously if I were to list
   all the words understood by the game a lot of the fun would disappear,
   but here are a few that might come in useful:

   SAY, HIT, ATTACK, GO, SHOUT, ASK, LIST, INVENTORY,EXAMINE, LOOK, HINT,
   SCORE, GIVE, PULL, PUSH, HELP, WEAR, GET, DROP, PUT, CLIMB, EAT, SAVE,
   LOAD, RAMSAVE, RAMLOAD, QUIT, and so on.

   The LIST and INVENTORY commands will tell you which objects you are
   carrying. Other useful keys to remember are the up and down arrows.

   The up and down arrows on the keyboard scroll through the last 10
   commands you have entered. This can be very helpful if you are a
   slower typist.

   At any time during the adventure you can SAVE your position on disk.
   This is a particularly good idea if you're about to do something
   dangerous (for example attacking someone).  When you do fail miserably
   at whatever tickled your fancy you can always restore your position
   with the LOAD command.

   There are various abbreviations available for quicker typing:

     X for EXAMINE object/thing/person
     L for LOOK
     I for INVENTORY of objects carried

   Frequently used directions like NORTH, SOUTH,  EAST, WEST, UP and DOWN
   can be shortened to N, S, E, W, U and D respectively.

   The CONFIG program allows players to choose their own colours.  You do
   not earn any extra points for bad taste.

   The HINT command enables the player to be gently prodded in the right
   direction with a hint (either subtle or sledgehammer) for the current
   location.

   Players of JACARANDA JIM will remember that I promised to fix their
   plumbing, mow their lawn and complete other varied household chores.

   I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that I will be around
   next Tuesday to finish dusting the tortilla.

   Be seeing you
